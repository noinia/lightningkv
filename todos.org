* TODO test querying


* DONE switch to Storable vectors
** DONE storable instances for the sum types

* TODO verify the efficiency of the storable instances

the compiler output says s.t. like:


GStorable instances will be optimised in the following order
    1: FlatNode

Errors while grouping bindings:
    Could not find any bindings.
    Is the second pass placed after main simplifier phases ?


not sure what that means


* TODO implement deletions
** TODO make some simple stub using binary trees first

** TODO tests for deletions

** TODO update the data type to allow for deleted items

internal nodes also may need to know when things were deleted.

read the details of the partial persistence stuff again to figure out
if we are still missing s.t.


* TODO implement building trees that are not of size 2^h for some h.

essentially mark these items as deleted at time 0.

* TODO support storing items on disk




* TODO Write benchmarks
