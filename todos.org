* TODO Unpack the Nodes

* TODO Implement Delete

to delete we can essentially just bottom up delete. If we delete
s.t. from the right child update the max to become Infty. If we delete
from the left, swap the left and right child.

claim is that this maintains cache obliviousness:

i.e. suppose we swap the children l and r of node v
- if l and r were in the same block as v, they remain so
- if l and r where in different blocks from v we needed an io to load
  either l or r anyway. That remains the same.

** TODO figure out how I actually want to do this, i.e. if I want to modify things in place yes or no.

* TODO set up testing
